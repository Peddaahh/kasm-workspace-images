# Custom Kasm Workspace images
Custom Kasm Workspace images with some extra tooling based on the [official images](https://github.com/kasmtech/workspaces-images). If a commonly used tool is missing feel free to create a pull request. To use these images download the official Workspace and then replace the docker image URL in your workplace settings. Images are automatically built weekly.

Currently included changes:
 - python
 - rust
 - sudo (NOPASSWD all)
 - zsh (oh-my-zsh)
 - Wireguard
 - 1password (amd64 & Ubuntu only)
